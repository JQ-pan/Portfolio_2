# Portfolio

I'm a programmer with a background in biology and health sciences. I have a passion for combining my knkowledge in the life sciences with my skills in software development to create innovative solutions.

## Background

I am a programmer with a background in biology and health sciences.

Whether it is treating patients or creating new projects, there is an element of care and attention to detail that leads me to a viable solution for the task at hand. Having taken courses during college that allowed me to acquire a new interest in coding, I continued to pursue my interest in software development after graduation.

As a full stack software enginner, I have enjoyed using Ruby, Javascript, React/Redux, Rails, PostgresQL, CSS, HTML, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js in my projects. I am currently self-learning Python. I am always finding time to learn more.
